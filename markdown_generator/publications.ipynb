      "44447\tAdapting Semi-Active Prostheses to Real-World Movements: Sensing and Controlling the Dynamic Mean Ankle Moment Arm with a Variable-Stiffness Foot on Ramps and Stairs\tSensors\t\"(1) Background: Semi-active prosthetic feet can provide adaptation in different circumstances, enabling greater function with less weight and complexity than fully powered prostheses. However, determining how to control semi-active devices is still a challenge. The dynamic mean ankle moment arm (DMAMA) provides a suitable biomechanical metric, as its simplicity matches that of a semi-active device. However, it is unknown how stiffness and locomotion modes affect DMAMA, which is necessary to create closed-loop controllers for semi-active devices. In this work, we develop a method to use only a prosthesis-embedded load sensor to measure DMAMA and classify locomotion modes, with the goal of achieving mode-dependent, closed-loop control of DMAMA using a variable-stiffness prosthesis. We study how stiffness and ground incline affect the DMAMA, and we establish the feasibility of classifying locomotion modes based exclusively on the load sensor. (2) Methods: Human subjects walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs while wearing a variable-stiffness prosthesis in low-, medium-, and high-stiffness settings. We computed DMAMA from sagittal load sensor data and prosthesis geometric measurements. We used linear mixed-effects models to determine subject-independent and subject-dependent sensitivity of DMAMA to incline and stiffness. We also used a machine learning model to classify locomotion modes using only the load sensor. (3) Results: We found a positive linear sensitivity of DMAMA to stiffness on ramps and level ground. Additionally, we found a positive linear sensitivity of DMAMA to ground slope in the low- and medium-stiffness conditions and a negative interaction effect between slope and stiffness. Considerable variability suggests that applications of DMAMA as a control input should look at the running average over several strides. To examine the efficacy of real-time DMAMA-based control systems, we used a machine learning model to classify locomotion modes using only the load sensor. The classifier achieved over 95% accuracy. (4) Conclusions: Based on these findings, DMAMA has potential for use as a closed-loop control input to adapt semi-active prostheses to different locomotion modes.\"\t\"Leestma, J. K., Fehr, K.

      "45456\tEstimation of minimum foot clearance using a single foot_mounted inertial sensor and personalized foot geometry scan\tScientific Reports\t\"The real-world measurement of minimum foot clearance (mFC) during the swing phase of gait is critical in efforts to understand and reduce the risk of trip-and-fall incidents in populations with gait impairments. Past research has focused on measuring clearance of a single point on a person�s foot, typically the toe�however, this may overestimate mFC and may even be the wrong region of the foot in cases of gait impairments or interventions. In this work, we present a novel method to reconstruct the swing-phase trajectory of an arbitrary number of points on a person�s shoe and estimate the instantaneous height and location of whole-foot mFC. This is achieved using a single foot-mounted inertial sensor and personalized shoe geometry scan, assuming a rigid-body IMU-shoe system. This combination allows collection and analysis using out-of-lab tests, potentially including clinical environments. Validation of single marker location using the proposed method vs. motion capture showed height errors with bias less than 0.05 mm, and 95% confidence interval of _ 8.18 to +_8.09 mm. The method is demonstrated in an example data set comparing different interventions for foot drop, and it shows clear differences among no intervention, functional electrical stimulation, and ankle�foot orthosis conditions. This method offers researchers and clinicians a rich understanding of a person�s gait by providing objective 3D foot kinematics and allowing a unique opportunity to view the regions of the foot where minimum clearance occurs. This information can contribute to a more informed recommendation of specific interventions or assistive technology than is currently possible in standard clinical practice.\"\t\"Fehr, K.
