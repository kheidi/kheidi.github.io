However, determining how to control semi-active devices is still a challenge. The dynamic mean ankle moment arm (DMAMA) provides a suitable biomechanical metric, as its simplicity matches that of a semi-active device. However, it is unknown how stiffness and locomotion modes affect DMAMA, which is necessary to create closed-loop controllers for semi-active devices. In this work, we develop a method to use only a prosthesis-embedded load sensor to measure DMAMA and classify locomotion modes, with the goal of achieving mode-dependent, closed-loop control of DMAMA using a variable-stiffness prosthesis. We study how stiffness and ground incline affect the DMAMA, and we establish the feasibility of classifying locomotion modes based exclusively on the load sensor. (2) Methods: Human subjects walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs while wearing a variable-stiffness prosthesis in low-, medium-, and high-stiffness settings. We computed DMAMA from sagittal load sensor data and prosthesis geometric measurements. We used linear mixed-effects models to determine subject-independent and subject-dependent sensitivity of DMAMA to incline and stiffness. We also used a machine learning model to classify locomotion modes using only the load sensor. (3) Results: We found a positive linear sensitivity of DMAMA to stiffness on ramps and level ground. Additionally, we found a positive linear sensitivity of DMAMA to ground slope in the low- and medium-stiffness conditions and a negative interaction effect between slope and stiffness. Considerable variability suggests that applications of DMAMA as a control input should look at the running average over several strides. To examine the efficacy of real-time DMAMA-based control systems, we used a machine learning model to classify locomotion modes using only the load sensor. The classifier achieved over 95% accuracy. (4) Conclusions: Based on these findings, DMAMA has potential for use as a closed-loop control input to adapt semi-active prostheses to different locomotion modes."	"Leestma, J. K., Fehr, K.

2024-06-13	Estimation of minimum foot clearance using a single foot_mounted inertial sensor and personalized foot geometry scan	Scientific Reports	"The real-world measurement of minimum foot clearance (mFC) during the swing phase of gait is critical in efforts to understand and reduce the risk of trip-and-fall incidents in populations with gait impairments. Past research has focused on measuring clearance of a single point on a person's foot, typically the toe'however, this may overestimate mFC and may even be the wrong region of the foot in cases of gait impairments or interventions. In this work, we present a novel method to reconstruct the swing-phase trajectory of an arbitrary number of points on a person's shoe and estimate the instantaneous height and location of whole-foot mFC. This is achieved using a single foot-mounted inertial sensor and personalized shoe geometry scan, assuming a rigid-body IMU-shoe system. This combination allows collection and analysis using out-of-lab tests, potentially including clinical environments. Validation of single marker location using the proposed method vs. motion capture showed height errors with bias less than 0.05 mm, and 95% confidence interval of _ 8.18 to +_8.09 mm. The method is demonstrated in an example data set comparing different interventions for foot drop, and it shows clear differences among no intervention, functional electrical stimulation, and ankle'foot orthosis conditions. This method offers researchers and clinicians a rich understanding of a person's gait by providing objective 3D foot kinematics and allowing a unique opportunity to view the regions of the foot where minimum clearance occurs. This information can contribute to a more informed recommendation of specific interventions or assistive technology than is currently possible in standard clinical practice."	"Fehr, K.

2024-04-22	Changes in Dynamic Mean Ankle Moment Arm in Unimpaired Walking Across Speeds, Ramps, and Stairs	Journal of Biomechanical Engineering	Understanding the natural biomechanics of walking at different speeds and activities is crucial to develop effective assistive devices for persons with lower-limb impairments. While continuous measures such as joint angle and moment are well-suited for biomimetic control of robotic systems, whole-stride summary metrics are useful for describing changes across behaviors and for designing and controlling passive and semi-active devices. Dynamic mean ankle moment arm (DMAMA) is a whole-stride measure representing the moment arm of the ground reaction impulse about the ankle joint—effectively, how “forefoot-dominated” or “hindfoot-dominated” a movement is. DMAMA was developed as a target and performance metric for semi-active devices that adjust once per stride. However, for implementation in this application, DMAMA must be characterized across various activities in unimpaired individuals. In our study, unimpaired participants walked at “slow,” “normal,” and “fast” self-selected speeds on level ground and at a normal self-selected speed while ascending and descending stairs and a 5-degree incline ramp. DMAMA measured from these activities displayed a borderline-significant negative sensitivity to walking speed, a significant positive sensitivity to ground incline, and a significant decrease when ascending stairs compared to descending. The data suggested a nonlinear relationship between DMAMA and walking speed; half of the participants had the highest average DMAMA at their “normal” speed. Our findings suggest that DMAMA varies substantially across activities, and thus, matching DMAMA could be a valuable metric to consider when designing biomimetic assistive lower-limb devices.

Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-based foot trajectory reconstruction is an essential component of estimating the foot motion and user position required for any related biomechanics metrics. However, limitations remain in the reconstruction quality due to well-known sensor noise and drift issues, and in some cases, limited sensor bandwidth and range. In this work, to reduce drift in the height direction and handle the impulsive velocity error at heel strike, we enhanced the integration reconstruction with a novel kinematic model that partitions integration velocity errors into estimates of acceleration bias and heel strike vertical velocity error. Using this model, we achieve reduced height drift in reconstruction and simultaneously accomplish reliable terrain determination among level ground, ramps, and stairs. The reconstruction performance of the proposed method is compared against the widely used Error State Kalman Filter-based Pedestrian Dead Reckoning and integration-based foot-IMU motion reconstruction method with 15 trials from six subjects, including one prosthesis user. The mean height errors per stride are 0.03±0.08 cm on level ground, 0.95±0.37 cm on ramps, and 1.27±1.22 cm on stairs. The proposed method can determine the terrain types accurately by thresholding on the model output and demonstrates great reconstruction improvement in level-ground walking and moderate improvement on ramps and stairs.
