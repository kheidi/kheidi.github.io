Hi 👋🏻! I'm a PhD Student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison conducting research at the Biomechatronics, Assistive Devices, Gait Engineering and Rehabilitation Laboratory, aka the [UW BADGER Lab](https://uwbadgerlab.engr.wisc.edu). My work currently focuses on the long-term analysis of impaired gait using wearable sensors, primarily comparing different prostheses and orthoses.
